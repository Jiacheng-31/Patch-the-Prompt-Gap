We need to prove that if the sequence is bounded, then it must converge.\n\nStep 2: Define a new sequence to simplify the inequality\nLet's define a new sequence $\\{d_n\\}$ such that $d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$. This allows us to rewrite the given inequality as $d_{n+1} \\le \\alpha d_n + (1-\\alpha)d_{n-1}$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the properties of the new sequence\nWe can see that $d_{n+1} \\le \\alpha d_n + (1-\\alpha)d_{n-1}$ is a recursive inequality that describes the relationship between consecutive terms of the sequence $\\{d_n\\}$. We can also see that $d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$ is the difference between consecutive terms of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$.\n\nStep 4: Show that the sequence $\\{d_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence\nWe can rewrite the recursive inequality as $d_{n+1} \\le (1-\\alpha)d_n + \\alpha d_{n-1}$. Let's define a new sequence $\\{r_n\\}$ such that $r_n = \\frac{d_{n+1}}{d_n}$. Then, we have $r_{n+1} \\le (1-\\alpha) + \\alpha r_n$. This shows that $\\{r_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $1-\\alpha$.\n\nStep 5: Show that the sequence $\\{d_n\\}$ is bounded\nSince $\\{d_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $1-\\alpha$, it is bounded if and only if $|1-\\alpha| < 1$. Since $\\alpha \\in (0, 1]$, we have $|1-\\alpha| < 1$, and therefore $\\{d_n\\}$ is bounded.\n\nStep 6: Show that the sequence $\\{d_n\\}$ converges to 0\nSince $\\{d_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $1-\\alpha$ and is bounded, it converges to 0.\n\nStep 7: Conclude that the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ converges\nSince $d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n \\to 0$, we have $a_{n+1} \\to a_n$. Therefore, the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ converges.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{None}}$",
